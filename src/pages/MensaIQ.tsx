    <p>
      Mensa is the world's oldest and largest high-IQ society, with over 145,000 members in 90+
      countries. To join, you need to score in the <strong>top 2%</strong> of the population on a
      standardized intelligence test — that's an IQ of approximately{" "}
      <Link to="/is-130-iq-good">130 or higher</Link>. Here's everything you need to know about
      qualifying, testing, and what membership actually involves.

    <h2>How to Take the Mensa Test</h2>
    <p>There are two ways to qualify for Mensa:</p>

    <h3>Option 1: Take the Mensa Admission Test</h3>
    <p>
      American Mensa offers its own admission test at local chapter events nationwide. The test
      costs about $40 and takes approximately 90 minutes. It includes two separate tests: the Mensa
      Admission Test (a culture-fair reasoning test) and the Mensa Wonderlic-style test. You receive
      your results within a few weeks. If you score at the 98th percentile on either test, you qualify.
    </p>

    <h3>Option 2: Submit Prior Test Scores</h3>
    <p>
      Mensa accepts qualifying scores from over 200 standardized tests, including:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>WAIS or WISC</strong> — score of 130+ (the gold standard)</li>
      <li><strong>Stanford-Binet</strong> — score of 130+ (SD 15) or 132+ (SD 16)</li>
      <li><strong>GRE</strong> — combined score of 1300+ (old scale) or approximate equivalent</li>
      <li><strong>SAT</strong> — score of 1250+ (pre-1994) — see our <Link to="/sat-to-iq">SAT to IQ conversion</Link></li>
      <li><strong>LSAT</strong> — score in the 95th+ percentile</li>
      <li><strong>ACT</strong> — composite score of 29+</li>
      <li><strong>Military ASVAB</strong> — AFQT score of 95+</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>What Does Mensa Membership Get You?</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Local chapter events</strong> — social gatherings, lectures, game nights with other high-IQ members</li>
      <li><strong>Special Interest Groups (SIGs)</strong> — 200+ groups covering everything from astronomy to wine tasting</li>
      <li><strong>Mensa Bulletin</strong> — monthly magazine with puzzles, articles, and member content</li>
      <li><strong>Annual Gathering</strong> — national convention with speakers, workshops, and social events</li>
      <li><strong>Networking</strong> — connections with accomplished people across diverse fields</li>
      <li><strong>Scholarships</strong> — Mensa Foundation awards over $200,000 annually in scholarships</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Is Mensa Worth Joining?</h2>
    <p>
      Opinions vary widely. Members report that the social connections and intellectual stimulation
      are the primary benefits — particularly for people who've felt intellectually isolated.
      Critics argue the $79/year dues aren't justified, and that defining yourself by an IQ score
      is limiting. The practical career value of Mensa membership is minimal — most employers
      don't care about it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The biggest value is typically for people who want to connect with intellectual peers in a
      low-pressure social environment. If that appeals to you, membership can be worthwhile.
    </p>

    <h2>How to Prepare for the Mensa Test</h2>
    <p>
      Since the Mensa test measures reasoning ability rather than knowledge, traditional "studying"
      doesn't apply. However, you can prepare by:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Practicing pattern recognition and matrix reasoning puzzles (similar to Raven's Progressive Matrices)</li>
      <li>Getting adequate sleep the night before (sleep deprivation can reduce effective IQ by 5-10 points)</li>
      <li>Eating well and staying hydrated on test day</li>
      <li>Managing test anxiety through relaxation techniques</li>
      <li>Taking practice IQ tests to familiarize yourself with the format</li>
    </ul>
