      </h1>

      <p>
        Your ACT score can offer a rough estimate of your IQ. While the ACT is a college readiness
        exam — not an intelligence test — research shows a correlation of approximately 0.7 between
        ACT performance and IQ scores on standardized tests. This means ACT scores are a meaningful
        but imperfect proxy for cognitive ability.

      <h2>Why ACT and IQ Correlate</h2>
      <p>
        Both the ACT and IQ tests draw on overlapping cognitive skills. The ACT's four sections —
        English, Math, Reading, and Science — all require:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Verbal reasoning</strong> — parsing complex text and identifying logical relationships</li>
        <li><strong>Quantitative reasoning</strong> — applying mathematical concepts under time pressure</li>
        <li><strong>Working memory</strong> — holding multiple pieces of information simultaneously</li>
        <li><strong>Processing speed</strong> — producing accurate answers quickly</li>
        <li><strong>Fluid reasoning</strong> — applying learned knowledge to novel problems</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Research by Frey and Detterman (2004) found a correlation of 0.77 between the old SAT and
        general intelligence (g). The ACT, which measures similar constructs, shows a comparable
        relationship. A correlation of ~0.7 means ACT scores explain roughly 49% of the variance
        in IQ — substantial, but far from the whole picture.
      </p>

      <h2>Achievement vs. Aptitude: Key Differences</h2>
      <p>
        The core distinction between the ACT and an IQ test is what each measures:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>ACT (achievement)</strong> — measures what you have learned in school: specific
          grammar rules, geometry formulas, biology concepts. Coaching, test prep, and strong
          schooling can meaningfully raise ACT scores.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>IQ (aptitude)</strong> — measures reasoning ability more independent of specific
          learned content. IQ is more resistant to coaching, though practice on test formats can
          still provide modest gains.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This means two students with identical IQs might score very differently on the ACT depending
        on school quality, effort, and test preparation. Conversely, a student who test-preps
        intensively may score higher on the ACT than their underlying cognitive ability would predict.

      <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

      <h3>What IQ is a 36 ACT?</h3>
      <p>
        A perfect 36 ACT score roughly corresponds to an IQ of approximately 145–150 — the
        exceptionally gifted range. Only about 0.1% of test-takers achieve a 36.
      </p>

      <h3>Can you convert ACT to IQ?</h3>
      <p>
        You can estimate IQ from ACT scores with moderate confidence. The correlation is roughly 0.7.
        A 30 ACT maps to approximately IQ 122–126, while a 24 maps to approximately IQ 107–111.
      </p>

      <h3>What ACT score is genius?</h3>
      <p>
        An ACT of 34+ roughly corresponds to the gifted/genius range (IQ 135+). A perfect 36
        maps to approximately IQ 145–150. For Mensa-level (top 2%), an ACT of 32 or higher is
        the rough threshold.
      </p>

      <h3>Is the ACT an IQ test?</h3>
      <p>
        No — the ACT tests academic achievement, not pure cognitive ability. However, ACT scores
        correlate with IQ at ~0.7, because both tasks require similar reasoning and verbal skills.
