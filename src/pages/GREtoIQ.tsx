        GRE to IQ Conversion: <span className="gradient-text">Estimate Your IQ from Your GRE Score</span>
      </h1>

      <p>
        The GRE (Graduate Record Examination) is one of the best standardized proxies for estimating
        cognitive ability beyond high school. Graduate applicants are typically older, more
        academically developed, and harder to compare on simple achievement metrics — making the GRE
        a particularly interesting lens for IQ estimation. Research suggests a correlation of
        approximately 0.6–0.7 between GRE total scores and IQ.

      <h2>GRE Verbal vs. Quantitative: Different IQ Dimensions</h2>
      <p>
        The two main GRE sections tap into different aspects of cognitive ability:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>GRE Verbal (130–170)</strong> — predicts crystallized intelligence: vocabulary
          depth, reading comprehension, analogical reasoning, and linguistic pattern recognition.
          High verbal scorers typically show strong verbal IQ (VIQ) and excel at humanities,
          law, and social science disciplines.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>GRE Quantitative (130–170)</strong> — predicts fluid intelligence: abstract
          reasoning, mathematical problem-solving, spatial thinking, and data analysis.
          High quant scorers typically show strong performance IQ (PIQ) and excel in
          STEM, economics, and engineering fields.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Research suggests GRE Verbal scores correlate slightly more strongly with overall g
        (general intelligence factor) than Quantitative, though both sections contribute
        meaningfully to a holistic IQ estimate. A perfect 170 Verbal with a lower Quant score
        may indicate a different cognitive profile than the reverse.
      </p>

      <h2>Why GRE-to-IQ Conversion Isn't Exact</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Population selection</strong> — GRE test-takers are already a pre-selected,
          college-educated population, compressing the range at the lower end. The average
          GRE test-taker is already smarter than the general population.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Test preparation</strong> — GRE scores can be improved substantially through
          practice, vocabulary memorization, and strategy coaching; raw IQ is less trainable.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Subject-specific knowledge</strong> — the Quantitative section assumes
          undergraduate-level math comfort, which varies by educational background.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Motivation and context</strong> — high-stakes graduate admissions motivate
          effort in ways that low-stakes IQ tests may not.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

      <h3>What IQ is a perfect 340 GRE?</h3>
      <p>
        A perfect 340 GRE (170V + 170Q) roughly corresponds to an IQ of 145 or above — the
        exceptionally gifted range. Fewer than 1% of test-takers achieve this.
      </p>

      <h3>What is a good GRE score for IQ purposes?</h3>
      <p>
        A GRE total of 320+ maps to approximately IQ 132–136 (gifted range). A score of 310
        maps to IQ 126–130 (superior), and 300 maps to IQ 120–124 (also superior).
      </p>

      <h3>Does the GRE Verbal or Quantitative section better predict IQ?</h3>
      <p>
        Both contribute meaningfully. GRE Verbal correlates slightly more with overall IQ (g),
        while GRE Quantitative predicts mathematical and fluid reasoning ability. Together they
        provide a more complete cognitive profile.
      </p>

      <h3>Is the GRE an IQ test?</h3>
      <p>
        No — the GRE is a graduate admissions test that measures academic aptitude, not pure
        general intelligence. However, GRE scores correlate with IQ at roughly 0.6–0.7, making
        it a useful proxy.
