      SAT to IQ Conversion: <span className="gradient-text">Estimate Your IQ from SAT Scores</span>
    </h1>

    <p>
      Many people wonder what their SAT score says about their IQ. While the SAT isn't an IQ test,
      the two are strongly correlated — research shows a correlation coefficient of about 0.7–0.8
      between SAT scores and IQ. This means your SAT score can provide a rough estimate of your
      cognitive ability, though it's not a perfect conversion.

    <h2>Why SAT and IQ Correlate</h2>
    <p>
      The SAT and IQ tests share underlying cognitive demands. Both require:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Logical reasoning</strong> — deducing correct answers through systematic thinking</li>
      <li><strong>Pattern recognition</strong> — identifying relationships in data and text</li>
      <li><strong>Working memory</strong> — holding multiple pieces of information simultaneously</li>
      <li><strong>Processing speed</strong> — working accurately under time pressure</li>
      <li><strong>Verbal comprehension</strong> — understanding complex reading passages</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The SAT was originally derived from Army IQ tests used in World War I. While the College Board
      has distanced the test from IQ measurement, the cognitive overlap remains substantial.
    </p>

    <h2>Why This Isn't a Perfect Conversion</h2>
    <p>
      Several important factors make SAT-to-IQ conversion imprecise:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Test preparation</strong> — SAT scores can be improved through coaching and practice; IQ is harder to train for</li>
      <li><strong>Subject knowledge</strong> — the SAT tests learned math and reading skills, not just raw ability</li>
      <li><strong>Motivation</strong> — students who care about college admission try harder on the SAT than they might on an IQ test</li>
      <li><strong>Score ceiling</strong> — the SAT caps at 1600, compressing differences at the top; IQ tests measure higher</li>
      <li><strong>Test anxiety</strong> — the high-stakes nature of the SAT affects some students more than a low-stakes IQ test would</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

    <h3>Can you convert SAT scores to IQ?</h3>
    <p>
      You can estimate IQ from SAT scores, but it's not exact. The correlation is about 0.7–0.8. A
      1200 SAT roughly corresponds to an IQ of ~115, while a 1400 SAT roughly corresponds to ~125.
    </p>

    <h3>What IQ is a 1500 SAT score?</h3>
    <p>
      A 1500 SAT roughly corresponds to an IQ of approximately 130–135, placing you in the{" "}
      <Link to="/is-130-iq-good">gifted range</Link>.
    </p>

    <h3>What IQ is a 1200 SAT score?</h3>
    <p>
      A 1200 SAT roughly corresponds to an IQ of approximately 113–117, placing you in the{" "}
      <Link to="/is-115-iq-good">high average range</Link>.
    </p>

    <h3>Is the SAT an IQ test?</h3>
    <p>
      No, the SAT is a college readiness assessment, not an IQ test. However, both tests require
      similar cognitive abilities, which is why they correlate strongly.
