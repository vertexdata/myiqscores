      <h2>Typical Cognitive Demands</h2>
      <p>{career.description}</p>

      <h2>Where These Numbers Come From</h2>
      <p>
        Occupational IQ estimates trace back to studies that measured cognitive test scores across
        professions — most famously mid-20th-century military induction data (such as Harrell &amp;
        Harrell's 1945 occupational tables) and later research linking standardized admission tests
        (MCAT, LSAT, GRE, ASVAB) to general cognitive ability. These sources are dated, based on group
        averages, and vary between studies, so treat the range above as an approximation of central
        tendency — not a measured fact about today's workforce, and never a cutoff for any individual.
