    <h1>IQ in the Workplace: <span className="gradient-text">What Employers and Employees</span> Need to Know</h1>

    <p>
      Among all the factors that predict how well someone will perform at a job, general cognitive
      ability — IQ — is consistently one of the most powerful. This finding, replicated across
      hundreds of studies spanning decades, has had enormous influence on how psychologists think
      about hiring, job design, and workforce development. Yet it remains widely misunderstood by
      both employers and employees.
    </p>
    <p>
      This guide covers what the research actually shows about IQ and workplace performance, which
      jobs require the most cognitive ability, how cognitive testing is used in modern hiring,
      and the important ways that IQ doesn't tell the whole story.
    </p>

    <h2>The Research Consensus: IQ Predicts Job Performance</h2>
    <p>
      The most comprehensive meta-analysis on this topic, by psychologists Frank Schmidt and John
      Hunter (1998), analyzed over 85 years of research involving hundreds of thousands of workers.
      Their conclusion: general cognitive ability (essentially IQ) is the single best predictor of
      job performance available to employers, with a validity coefficient of approximately 0.51 for
      complex jobs.
    </p>
    <p>
      To put that in context:
    </p>
    <table>
      <thead>
        <tr><th>Predictor</th><th>Validity (Correlation with Job Performance)</th></tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr><td>General cognitive ability (IQ)</td><td>0.51</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Work sample tests</td><td>0.54</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Structured interviews</td><td>0.51</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Conscientiousness (personality)</td><td>0.31</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Job experience</td><td>0.18</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Years of education</td><td>0.10</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Unstructured interviews</td><td>0.38</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Reference checks</td><td>0.26</td></tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
    <p>
      IQ outperforms job experience, years of education, and most personality traits as a predictor
      of job performance. When combined with conscientiousness (a personality factor), predictive
      validity reaches approximately 0.63 — meaning together, IQ and conscientiousness explain
      about 40% of the variance in job performance. That's remarkably high for behavioral prediction.
    </p>

    <h2>Why IQ Predicts Job Performance</h2>
    <p>
      The mechanism is straightforward: higher cognitive ability facilitates faster and better
      learning on the job. More intelligent employees:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Learn new skills, procedures, and tools more quickly</li>
      <li>Generate more effective solutions to novel problems</li>
      <li>Communicate more clearly and persuasively</li>
      <li>Adapt more readily to changing job demands</li>
      <li>Make better decisions in complex, uncertain situations</li>
      <li>Process information from multiple sources more efficiently</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      This is why the relationship between IQ and job performance is strongest for the most
      cognitively complex jobs (manager, engineer, scientist, physician) and weakest for simple,
      highly routinized tasks that require minimal reasoning or learning.
    </p>

    <h2>IQ Requirements by Career Category</h2>
    <p>
      Research has documented typical IQ ranges for different occupational categories. These are
      population averages — there's enormous individual variation within each occupation:
    </p>
    <table>
      <thead>
        <tr><th>Occupation Category</th><th>Average IQ Range</th><th>Top Performers</th></tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr><td>Professors / researchers</td><td>125–135</td><td>145+</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Physicians / surgeons</td><td>120–130</td><td>140+</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Lawyers / judges</td><td>115–130</td><td>135+</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Engineers (technical)</td><td>115–130</td><td>135+</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Managers (senior)</td><td>115–125</td><td>135+</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Teachers</td><td>110–120</td><td>130+</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Skilled trades</td><td>100–115</td><td>125+</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Sales (complex B2B)</td><td>105–120</td><td>130+</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Administrative roles</td><td>95–110</td><td>120+</td></tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>

    <h2>How Cognitive Testing Is Used in Hiring</h2>
    <p>
      Given the strong predictive power of cognitive ability, many employers use cognitive
      assessments in their hiring process — though they rarely call them "IQ tests":
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Wonderlic Personnel Test</strong> — 50-question cognitive ability test, famous
        for use by NFL teams to screen quarterback candidates. Also widely used in business.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Criteria Cognitive Aptitude Test (CCAT)</strong> — measures verbal, math, and
        spatial reasoning; used by thousands of companies for professional roles.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Raven's Progressive Matrices</strong> — culture-reduced fluid intelligence test;
        used internationally by large employers to minimize educational background bias.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>McKinsey Problem Solving Test</strong> — consulting firms use proprietary tests
        that closely resemble fluid IQ assessments.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Google's hiring process</strong> — historically included cognitive ability
        assessments (though Google has shifted to more structured interviews and work samples).
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Legal and Ethical Considerations</h2>
    <p>
      The use of cognitive ability tests in hiring raises important legal and ethical questions.
      In the United States, the Supreme Court case <em>Griggs v. Duke Power Co.</em> (1971)
      established that employment tests producing adverse impact on protected classes must be
      demonstrably job-related. Because cognitive tests sometimes show group differences in average
      scores (though with enormous overlap), their use requires careful validation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Modern best practice involves:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Using cognitive tests only when validated for the specific job requirements</li>
      <li>Combining cognitive tests with other predictors (structured interviews, work samples)</li>
      <li>Setting appropriate score thresholds rather than maximizing IQ</li>
      <li>Using culture-fair versions of tests where possible</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>The Threshold Effect: Why IQ Isn't Everything at Work</h2>
    <p>
      While IQ predicts job performance powerfully, research also suggests a "threshold effect" —
      IQ matters most when it's lower, and its marginal value diminishes above a certain level.
      Once someone has enough cognitive ability to learn and perform the core job demands, additional
      IQ points produce diminishing returns, while other factors become more important:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Conscientiousness</strong> — reliability, diligence, and persistence</li>
      <li><strong>Emotional intelligence</strong> — leadership, teamwork, client relationships</li>
      <li><strong>Motivation and drive</strong> — willingness to put in sustained effort</li>
      <li><strong>Domain knowledge</strong> — crystallized expertise in the relevant field</li>
      <li><strong>Communication skills</strong> — ability to convey ideas clearly</li>
      <li><strong>Cultural fit</strong> — alignment with organizational values</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      This explains a phenomenon many people observe: some highly intelligent people underperform
      in their careers while some people with more modest cognitive ability achieve remarkable
      success. IQ opens doors, but character, EQ, and effort determine whether you walk through
      them and what you do once inside.
    </p>

    <h2>IQ and Entrepreneurship</h2>
    <p>
      Entrepreneurship deserves special mention because it has a different IQ profile than
      traditional employment. Research finds that successful entrepreneurs don't have the highest
      average IQs — they typically score in the 100–120 range, rather than the 125+ seen in the
      most cognitively demanding professional roles.
    </p>
    <p>
      This may reflect that entrepreneurship rewards a different combination of traits: moderate
      to high cognitive ability plus high tolerance for ambiguity and risk, strong persistence and
      resilience, creative pattern-matching, and high conscientiousness — rather than the pure
      analytical horsepower that dominates academic and research roles.
    </p>

    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

    <h3>Does IQ predict job performance?</h3>
    <p>
      Yes, strongly. IQ has a validity coefficient of ~0.51 for complex jobs — one of the
      strongest predictors ever studied. It outperforms job experience, years of education, and
      most personality traits. See our <Link to="/blog/iq-vs-success">IQ vs. success</Link> guide
      for broader context.
    </p>

    <h3>What IQ is needed to be a CEO?</h3>
    <p>
      Research suggests most Fortune 500 CEOs have IQs in the 115–135 range. The CEO role
      rewards a combination of cognitive ability, EQ, leadership skills, and strategic vision —
      not maximum IQ. See our <Link to="/iq-needed-for/ceo">CEO IQ profile</Link>.
    </p>

    <h3>Do employers test IQ?</h3>
    <p>
      Many do, though tests are usually called cognitive ability assessments. The Wonderlic, CCAT,
      and Raven's Matrices are commonly used. Consulting firms, finance, and tech companies are
      among the heaviest users of cognitive screening.
    </p>

    <h3>Is emotional intelligence more important than IQ at work?</h3>
    <p>
      Depends on the role. IQ dominates for cognitively demanding individual contributor roles;
      EQ dominates for people management and leadership. The combination of both is most powerful.
