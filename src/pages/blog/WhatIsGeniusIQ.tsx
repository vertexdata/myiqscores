    <h1>What Is a <span className="gradient-text">Genius IQ</span>? The History, Science &amp; Reality</h1>

    <p>
      "Genius" is one of the most overused words in popular culture. We call musicians geniuses,
      athletes geniuses, entrepreneurs geniuses. But in the context of IQ testing, genius has a
      specific technical meaning — and the reality of what it means to score at that level is more
      complicated, and more human, than the mythology suggests.
    </p>

    <h2>A Brief History of "Genius" in IQ Testing</h2>
    <p>
      The association between IQ scores and the word "genius" dates to Lewis Terman, the Stanford
      psychologist who developed the Stanford-Binet test in the 1910s. Terman's classification
      scheme placed IQ 140 and above in a category he labeled "Near genius or genius." This
      threshold stuck in the popular imagination.
    </p>
    <p>
      Terman's "Termites" — the famous longitudinal study of high-IQ children he began in 1921 —
      had a minimum IQ of around 135-140. Terman believed that identifying and cultivating these
      children would unlock extraordinary societal benefits. His implicit assumption: genius IQ =
      genius achievement.
    </p>
    <p>
      As we discussed in our <Link to="/genius-iq">Genius IQ guide</Link>, the results were more
      complicated. The Termites did well on average, but the handful of children Terman rejected
      for being "too low" in IQ (around 130-135) included future Nobel laureates William Shockley
      and Luis Alvarez.
    </p>

    <h2>Modern Definitions: Where Is the Threshold?</h2>
    <p>
      There is no universally agreed definition of "genius IQ." Different organizations and
      researchers use different thresholds:
    </p>
    <table>
      <thead>
        <tr><th>Threshold</th><th>% of Population</th><th>Organization / Source</th></tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr><td>IQ 130</td><td>~2%</td><td>Mensa membership minimum; some psychologists' "gifted" definition</td></tr>
        <tr><td>IQ 140</td><td>~0.4%</td><td>Terman's original "genius" threshold; most widely cited</td></tr>
        <tr><td>IQ 145</td><td>~0.13%</td><td>Some modern definitions of "highly gifted"</td></tr>
        <tr><td>IQ 160</td><td>~0.003%</td><td>Often cited as "extraordinary genius" level</td></tr>
        <tr><td>IQ 180+</td><td>~1 in 3 million</td><td>"Profoundly gifted"; associated with <Link to="/highest-iq-ever">highest IQs ever recorded</Link></td></tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
    <p>
      The <Link to="/mensa-iq-test">Mensa IQ threshold</Link> of 130 (98th percentile) is the most
      institutionally formalized definition of exceptionally high intelligence, though Mensa
      itself does not use the word "genius."
    </p>

    <h2>What Genius Looks Like in Practice</h2>
    <p>
      People with IQs in the 140–160+ range typically experience the world differently in a few
      specific ways:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Faster pattern recognition</strong> — connections that take others minutes become
        apparent in seconds. Complex systems feel intuitive.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Higher working memory capacity</strong> — the ability to hold and manipulate more
        information simultaneously, enabling more complex reasoning chains.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Faster learning</strong> — new concepts are acquired more rapidly, requiring
        fewer repetitions to reach mastery.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Greater asynchronous development</strong> — very high-IQ children often develop
        intellectually far ahead of emotional and social maturity, creating challenges in school
        environments.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      What genius IQ doesn't guarantee: happiness, emotional stability, social success, creative
      output, or professional achievement. Psychiatric conditions are actually somewhat
      over-represented at the extreme high end of the IQ distribution.
    </p>

    <h2>The Savant Phenomenon</h2>
    <p>
      Savants — individuals with extraordinary abilities in specific domains coexisting with
      significant cognitive or developmental disabilities — complicate simple IQ narratives.
      Kim Peek, the inspiration for Rain Man, could memorize entire books but couldn't button
      his own shirt. Daniel Tammet calculated pi to 22,514 decimal places from memory and taught
      himself Icelandic in a week, yet has significant social difficulties.
    </p>
    <p>
      Savant abilities demonstrate that specific cognitive capacities can exist at genius-level
      intensity in relative isolation from general IQ. This suggests IQ is measuring something
      real but not the entire picture of human cognitive capacity.
    </p>

    <h2>The Difference Between High IQ and Creative Genius</h2>
    <p>
      Some of the most consequential "geniuses" in history — Einstein, Darwin, Picasso,
      Shakespeare — are distinguished not by raw IQ but by a combination of deep knowledge,
      novel synthesis, and relentless focus on questions that others ignored. Psychologist
      Dean Keith Simonton argues that creative genius requires high intelligence but is also
      critically dependent on openness to experience, intrinsic motivation, and spending years
      immersed in a domain.
    </p>
    <p>
      The "10,000-hour rule" popularized by Malcolm Gladwell (based on research by Anders Ericsson)
      suggests that expert-level performance in any domain requires massive deliberate practice —
      regardless of IQ starting point. The highest achievers typically combine high ability with
      exceptional work ethic and domain expertise.
