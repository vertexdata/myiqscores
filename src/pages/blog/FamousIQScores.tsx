    <h1>The Most <span className="gradient-text">Surprising Celebrity IQ Scores</span> Ever Revealed</h1>

    <p>
      Celebrity IQ claims are everywhere — but how accurate are they? Some are based on documented
      test scores, others on self-reports or estimations by researchers. We've compiled a list of
      the most notable famous IQ scores, sorted out what's verified versus estimated, and
      highlighted the ones that surprised us most.

    <h2>Who's Surprisingly High?</h2>

    <h3>Dolph Lundgren (160)</h3>
    <p>
      Best known as Ivan Drago in Rocky IV, Lundgren holds a master's degree in chemical engineering
      from the Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm and was awarded a Fulbright scholarship
      to MIT. His estimated IQ of 160 is almost certainly not far off — and is a reminder that
      Hollywood doesn't require you to leave your brain at the door.
    </p>

    <h3>Quentin Tarantino (163)</h3>
    <p>
      The director of Pulp Fiction, Kill Bill, and Inglourious Basterds famously dropped out of
      high school. Yet his IQ was reportedly tested at 163 when he was six years old. His
      extraordinary recall of film history and ability to construct labyrinthine narrative
      structures supports the estimate. A reminder that IQ and formal education are not the
      same thing.
    </p>

    <h3>Garry Kasparov (190)</h3>
    <p>
      The former world chess champion's documented IQ of ~190 places him among the highest
      ever formally recorded. Chess mastery at the grandmaster level requires extraordinary
      pattern recognition, working memory, and long-horizon planning — all core IQ domains. For
      more on the upper extremes of intelligence, see our{" "}

    </p>

    <h2>Who's Surprisingly Low (or Just Human)?</h2>

    <h3>Jodie Foster (132)</h3>
    <p>
      A two-time Oscar winner who graduated magna cum laude from Yale, Foster's IQ of ~132 is
      exceptional by any normal standard — but lower than the 160+ scores often attributed to the
      "smartest" celebrities. It's a reminder that extraordinary achievement in creative fields
      requires much more than raw IQ.
    </p>

    <h3>Stephen Hawking ("I have no idea")</h3>
    <p>
      When asked his IQ, Hawking famously replied: "I have no idea. People who boast about their
      IQ are losers." His theoretical physics work at Cambridge was undeniably exceptional — but
      there's no formal documented test score. His estimated ~160 is an inference, not a measurement.
    </p>

    <h2>Important Caveats About Celebrity IQ Estimates</h2>
    <p>
      The vast majority of celebrity IQ scores circulating online are <strong>not verified</strong>.
      They come from a mix of self-reports, journalist estimates, researcher inferences from academic
      records, and outright fabrication. Even when a real test was taken, it may have been a
      specific instrument in unusual conditions that doesn't map cleanly to a population-normed
      IQ score.
    </p>
    <p>
      Additionally, IQ has a measurement error of approximately 5–7 points even on well-designed
      clinical tests. A reported score of "163" should be understood as somewhere in the range of
      155–170. The league tables of celebrity IQs are entertainment — not precise science.
    </p>
    <p>
      What they do illustrate is that remarkable cognitive ability can show up in surprising places —
      actors, athletes, entertainers — and that formal credentials (or lack thereof) are a poor
      proxy for intelligence.
