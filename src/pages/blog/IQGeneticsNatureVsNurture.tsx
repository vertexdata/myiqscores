    <h1>IQ and Genetics: <span className="gradient-text">Nature vs. Nurture</span> — What Science Actually Says</h1>

    <p>
      Few questions in psychology generate more controversy than the genetics of intelligence. Is IQ
      mostly inherited? Can environment overcome genetic limitations? Do genes determine your
      intellectual ceiling? The public debate is often polarized between those who overstate the role
      of genetics and those who deny it altogether. The actual science is far more nuanced — and more
      interesting — than either extreme suggests.
    </p>

    <h2>What Heritability Actually Means</h2>
    <p>
      Before diving into the numbers, it's critical to understand what "heritability" means — and
      what it doesn't mean. Heritability is a statistical measure of how much of the <em>variation</em>{" "}
      in a trait within a specific population and environment can be attributed to genetic differences.
    </p>
    <p>
      Key things heritability does NOT mean:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>It is not fixed.</strong> Heritability changes across different environments. In a
        population where everyone has identical environments, all variation would be genetic and
        heritability would be 100%. In a population with wildly different environments, more
        variation would be environmental and heritability would be lower.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>It does not mean environment is unimportant.</strong> A trait can be 80% heritable
        and still be dramatically changed by environment. Height is highly heritable, yet average
        human height has increased by 10+ cm over 150 years due to better nutrition.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>It is not deterministic.</strong> High heritability tells you about populations,
        not about any individual's potential or ceiling.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>What Twin Studies Tell Us</h2>
    <p>
      The most powerful method for estimating heritability is the comparison of identical (MZ) and
      fraternal (DZ) twins. Identical twins share 100% of their DNA; fraternal twins share about
      50%, the same as regular siblings. By comparing how similar identical twins are versus
      fraternal twins on a trait, researchers can estimate how much genetic variation accounts for
      the observed differences.
    </p>
    <p>
      The most informative studies examine <strong>identical twins raised apart</strong> — who share
      genes but not environment. The famous Minnesota Twin Study (Bouchard et al., 1990) followed
      136 pairs of identical twins raised in different families and found that they had strikingly
      similar IQ scores despite growing up in completely different households.
    </p>
    <p>
      Across dozens of large twin studies, the consensus estimates for IQ heritability are:
    </p>
    <table>
      <thead>
        <tr><th>Age Group</th><th>Estimated Heritability of IQ</th></tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr><td>Early childhood (4–6)</td><td>~40%</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Late childhood (7–12)</td><td>~50–60%</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Adolescence (13–18)</td><td>~60–70%</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Adulthood (18–65)</td><td>~70–80%</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Older adulthood (65+)</td><td>~60–70%</td></tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
    <p>
      The increase in heritability with age is counterintuitive but has been replicated consistently.
      The leading explanation is that as people gain autonomy, they increasingly select environments
      that match their genetic predispositions — a process called gene-environment correlation.
      Adults choose friends, careers, and hobbies that fit who they are; children largely have
      environments chosen for them.
    </p>

    <h2>What Adoption Studies Tell Us</h2>
    <p>
      Adoption studies provide a complementary lens. Children placed in adoptive homes early in life
      initially show IQ gains correlated with their adoptive family's environment. However,
      longitudinal studies consistently find that by late adolescence and adulthood, the IQ of
      adoptees converges toward their biological parents' IQ rather than their adoptive parents'.
    </p>
    <p>
      This doesn't mean adoptive environments don't matter — they absolutely do, especially for
      children adopted from severely deprived environments. But it does mean that shared family
      environment explains surprisingly little of the variance in adult IQ, once genetic factors
      are controlled.
    </p>
    <p>
      Paradoxically, non-shared environment (unique experiences, peer groups, random life events)
      explains more of the remaining variance in adult IQ than shared family environment does.
    </p>

    <h2>The Genetics of IQ: What We've Learned from GWAS</h2>
    <p>
      Modern genomics has transformed our understanding of the genetic architecture of intelligence.
      Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) — which scan millions of genetic variants across the
      genomes of hundreds of thousands of people — have revealed a striking picture:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>IQ is highly polygenic</strong> — influenced by thousands of genetic variants,
        each with tiny individual effects (typically &lt;0.1 IQ points per variant)
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>No single "intelligence gene" exists.</strong> There is no BRCA-equivalent
        for intelligence — no variant that dramatically raises or lowers IQ on its own
      </li>
      <li>
        The largest GWAS of cognitive ability (Savage et al., 2018 — 300,000 participants)
        identified over 1,000 significant genetic variants
      </li>
      <li>
        GWAS-based heritability estimates ("SNP heritability") typically run 20–30% — lower than
        twin-based estimates, partly because GWAS captures common variants only and misses rare
        variants and gene-gene interactions
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Polygenic scores for cognitive ability — which aggregate thousands of tiny genetic effects into
      a single score — can explain about 10–15% of variance in IQ. This is modest but scientifically
      significant, and the predictive power will increase as datasets grow.
    </p>

    <h2>Gene-Environment Interaction</h2>
    <p>
      One of the most important findings from modern behavioral genetics is that genes and environment
      don't simply add up — they interact. The same genetic predisposition can produce very different
      outcomes in different environments.
    </p>
    <p>
      A landmark example: a classic study by Turkheimer et al. (2003) found that heritability of IQ
      was nearly zero in impoverished families and approximately 60% in affluent families. This makes
      intuitive sense: in environments of severe deprivation (malnutrition, trauma, lack of
      stimulation), environmental variation overwhelms genetic variation. In enriched, stable
      environments, individual genetic differences have more room to express themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      This finding has profound implications. It means that interventions to improve environmental
      quality — particularly in deprived populations — have the highest potential leverage on
      cognitive outcomes. Genes are not destiny; they operate within environmental contexts.
    </p>

    <h2>The Flynn Effect as Proof of Environment's Power</h2>
    <p>
      The strongest evidence that environment powerfully shapes IQ — despite high heritability —
      is the <Link to="/blog/flynn-effect">Flynn Effect</Link>. Average IQ scores rose approximately
      30 points over the 20th century in developed nations. This is a massive change that occurred
      over just a few generations — far too fast to be driven by genetic change. It demonstrates
      that even a highly heritable trait can be dramatically altered by environmental improvements.
    </p>

    <h2>Can You Improve Your IQ Despite Genetics?</h2>
    <p>
      Yes — and the mechanisms are increasingly well understood:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Nutrition</strong> — especially in early development, adequate nutrition (including
        iodine, iron, omega-3 fatty acids) strongly affects brain development and IQ. Deficiencies
        during critical periods can permanently impair cognitive development.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Education</strong> — schooling has a causal effect on IQ. Studies using natural
        experiments (comparing people just above and below school-enrollment age cutoffs) consistently
        find that each additional year of schooling raises IQ by approximately 1–5 points.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Reducing environmental toxins</strong> — eliminating lead, reducing prenatal alcohol
        exposure, and controlling air pollution all demonstrably raise cognitive performance.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Exercise and sleep</strong> — aerobic exercise and adequate sleep improve working
        memory and fluid reasoning, with measurable effects on IQ-adjacent tasks.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

    <h3>How much of IQ is genetic?</h3>
    <p>
      In adults in typical Western environments, genetic factors account for 50–80% of IQ variance.
      Heritability increases with age. However, this doesn't mean environmental improvements can't
      dramatically shift IQ — the <Link to="/blog/flynn-effect">Flynn Effect</Link> proves they can.
    </p>

    <h3>Can a child be smarter than their parents?</h3>
    <p>
      Absolutely. IQ is probabilistic, not deterministic. Children receive a random mix of parental
      genes, and environmental factors also play a large role. Regression to the mean also means
      children of very high-IQ parents tend to regress somewhat toward the population average.
    </p>

    <h3>Which genes affect IQ?</h3>
    <p>
      Thousands of genetic variants each contribute tiny effects. No single "intelligence gene"
      exists. IQ is among the most polygenic traits studied, with each contributing variant
      accounting for less than 0.1 IQ points on average.
    </p>

    <h3>Does environment still matter if IQ is mostly genetic?</h3>
    <p>
      Yes. High heritability within a population doesn't mean environment is powerless — especially
      in deprived conditions where environmental factors dominate. The Flynn Effect provides
      definitive proof that environment can produce large population-level IQ changes.
