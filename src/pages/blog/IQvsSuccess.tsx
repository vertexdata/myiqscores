    <h1>IQ vs. <span className="gradient-text">Success</span>: Does a Higher IQ Mean a Better Life?</h1>

    <p>
      The relationship between IQ and life outcomes is one of the most studied — and most
      misunderstood — questions in social science. Yes, IQ predicts success. But how strongly?
      And does it matter more or less than other traits? The data tells a nuanced story that most
      popular narratives get wrong in both directions.
    </p>

    <h2>What the Correlations Actually Show</h2>
    <p>
      After decades of research, psychologists have established reasonably consistent correlations
      between IQ and major life outcomes. Here's what the evidence shows:
    </p>
    <table>
      <thead>
        <tr><th>Life Outcome</th><th>Correlation with IQ</th><th>Notes</th></tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr><td>Educational attainment</td><td>~0.55</td><td>Strongest predictor of years in school</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Job performance (complex roles)</td><td>~0.50</td><td>Strongest in high-complexity jobs</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Income</td><td>~0.40</td><td>Weaker than many assume</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Health outcomes</td><td>~0.30–0.40</td><td>Via health literacy and behavior</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Longevity</td><td>~0.20–0.30</td><td>Partially through health behaviors</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Life satisfaction</td><td>~0.10–0.20</td><td>Very weak relationship</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Criminal behavior</td><td>~-0.20</td><td>Modest inverse correlation</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Leadership effectiveness</td><td>~0.25–0.35</td><td>Plateaus at ~120 IQ</td></tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
    <p>
      A correlation of 0.5 is substantial in social science — but it means IQ explains only about
      25% of variance in that outcome. For income, with a correlation of 0.4, IQ explains only
      16% of why incomes vary. The remaining 84% comes from other factors.
    </p>

    <h2>The Terman "Termites" Study: A 70-Year Natural Experiment</h2>
    <p>
      In the 1920s, Stanford psychologist Lewis Terman identified about 1,500 high-IQ children
      (average IQ around 150) and tracked them for the rest of their lives in one of psychology's
      most famous longitudinal studies. He called them "Termites."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Termites did well on average — many became professors, lawyers, and executives.
      But several striking findings challenged simple IQ determinism. The most and least successful
      Termites had nearly identical average IQs. What separated the top third from the bottom third?
      Not IQ — <strong>conscientiousness, self-confidence, emotional stability, and family
      support</strong>. Two children excluded from the study for having "too low" an IQ (around
      135) grew up to win Nobel Prizes.
    </p>

    <h2>The 120 IQ Threshold: Where Returns Diminish</h2>
    <p>
      Research by psychologist Liam Hudson and others suggests that above an IQ of approximately
      <strong>120</strong>, additional IQ points contribute little to real-world achievement or
      success. Within the range of 80–120, IQ is a meaningful predictor of performance. Above 120,
      personality traits, motivation, creativity, and social skills dominate.
    </p>
    <p>
      This threshold effect explains why the most successful people in most fields don't necessarily
      have the highest IQs — they have "good enough" IQ combined with exceptional drive, resilience,
      and interpersonal skills. A surgeon with an IQ of 125 and extraordinary conscientiousness
      will typically outperform a surgeon with an IQ of 145 and poor work habits.

    <h2>EQ, Conscientiousness, and Grit as Predictors</h2>
    <p>
      Meta-analyses consistently show that certain non-cognitive traits predict success as strongly
      as or more strongly than IQ in many contexts:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Conscientiousness</strong> — the "Big Five" personality trait associated with
        organization, diligence, and reliability — predicts job performance with a correlation
        of ~0.3 and is a better predictor of academic grades than IQ in many studies.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Emotional intelligence (EQ)</strong> — especially in leadership and interpersonal
        roles. Research by Daniel Goleman suggests EQ accounts for 2x the performance variance
        of IQ in management positions. Read our full{" "}
        <Link to="/iq-vs-eq">IQ vs. EQ comparison</Link> for more.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Grit</strong> — Angela Duckworth's measure of passion and perseverance predicts
        graduation rates, military training completion, and career achievement independently of IQ.
        In her West Point study, grit was a better predictor of completing "Beast Barracks" than
        any cognitive measure.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>IQ and Health: The Surprising Connection</h2>
    <p>
      One of the more surprising findings in IQ research is that higher IQ predicts better health
      outcomes — not because smart people are intrinsically healthier, but because <strong>health
      literacy mediates health behaviors</strong>. People with higher IQs are better at
      understanding medical instructions, navigating healthcare systems, making long-term health
      tradeoffs, and avoiding dangerous behaviors.
    </p>
    <p>
      A landmark Scottish study tracking individuals from childhood found that IQ at age 11
      predicted mortality risk at age 76, even after controlling for socioeconomic status. The
      effect size was modest but real.
    </p>

    <h2>The Honest Summary</h2>
    <p>
      A higher IQ gives you a statistical advantage in education, complex careers, and health
      decision-making. But it's not destiny. The massive variance left unexplained by IQ is filled
      by traits you have more control over: work ethic, social skills, emotional regulation,
      resilience, and the quality of relationships and opportunities in your life. IQ opens doors —
      what you do with them is largely up to everything else you bring.
