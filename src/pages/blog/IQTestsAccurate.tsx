    <h1>Are IQ Tests <span className="gradient-text">Actually Accurate</span>? A Balanced Look</h1>

    <p>
      Few scientific instruments have been more celebrated and more attacked than IQ tests. Critics
      call them culturally biased tools of oppression. Advocates call them among the most validated
      measures in all of psychology. The truth, as usual, is more nuanced than either camp admits.
      Here's what the research actually shows.
    </p>

    <h2>Test-Retest Reliability: The Foundation of Accuracy</h2>
    <p>
      Before an instrument can be "accurate," it must be <strong>reliable</strong> — producing
      consistent results when measuring the same thing repeatedly. Well-designed clinical IQ tests
      have impressive reliability. The WAIS-IV (Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale, 4th edition)
      shows test-retest reliability of approximately <strong>0.90–0.96</strong> across subtests,
      where 1.0 would be perfect consistency. The Stanford-Binet 5 is similarly reliable.
    </p>
    <p>
      What this means practically: if you take a clinical IQ test today and again in three months,
      your scores will typically differ by fewer than 5 points. Larger swings occasionally occur
      due to fatigue, anxiety, illness, or major life changes — but the instrument itself is
      highly consistent.
    </p>

    <h2>Predictive Validity: Does IQ Actually Predict Anything?</h2>
    <p>
      Reliability is necessary but not sufficient. An instrument must also be <strong>valid</strong>
      — measuring what it claims to measure and predicting what it should predict. IQ tests have
      substantial predictive validity across numerous domains:
    </p>
    <table>
      <thead>
        <tr><th>Outcome</th><th>Correlation with IQ</th><th>Research Basis</th></tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr><td>Academic achievement</td><td>~0.50</td><td>Thousands of studies; highly consistent</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Job performance (complex roles)</td><td>~0.50</td><td>Schmidt &amp; Hunter meta-analysis (1998, 2004)</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Job performance (all roles)</td><td>~0.40</td><td>Lower for routine tasks</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Income</td><td>~0.40</td><td>Moderate; non-cognitive factors explain most variance</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Health literacy</td><td>~0.50</td><td>Strong predictor of health behavior</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Training success</td><td>~0.55</td><td>Especially in military and technical programs</td></tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
    <p>
      The Schmidt and Hunter meta-analysis — one of the largest in industrial psychology —
      concluded that general cognitive ability (g-factor) is the single best predictor of job
      performance across virtually all occupations and contexts.
    </p>

    <h2>What IQ Tests Measure Well</h2>
    <p>
      IQ tests are best at measuring the <strong>g-factor</strong> — general cognitive ability —
      which underlies performance across diverse cognitive tasks. They reliably capture working
      memory capacity, processing speed, fluid reasoning, verbal comprehension, and spatial
      reasoning. These are real, meaningful cognitive differences that predict meaningful outcomes.

    </p>

    <h2>What IQ Tests Measure Poorly</h2>
    <p>
      IQ tests struggle with:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Creative intelligence</strong> — the ability to generate novel ideas, make
        unexpected connections, and produce original work. Some researchers argue this is a
        distinct cognitive faculty not captured by standard IQ.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Practical intelligence</strong> — Robert Sternberg's "tacit knowledge" and
        street smarts that predict success in real-world environments but correlate poorly
        with IQ scores.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Emotional and social intelligence</strong> — see our{" "}
        <Link to="/what-is-iq">What Is IQ</Link> page for the full picture.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Motivation and effort</strong> — IQ is a capacity measure, not a performance
        measure. What you do with your capacity depends on factors IQ doesn't capture.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Cultural Bias: The Most Contested Issue</h2>
    <p>
      IQ tests show different average scores across racial and cultural groups. Whether this
      represents <em>test bias</em> (the instrument unfairly disadvantages some groups) or
      <em>valid measurement</em> of real differences caused by environmental factors is one of
      psychology's most contested questions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Modern test developers work hard to reduce overt cultural loading: using diagrams instead
      of culturally specific language, removing items with differential item functioning across
      groups. Raven's Progressive Matrices — a purely visual pattern-recognition test — was
      specifically designed to minimize cultural and linguistic bias.
    </p>
    <p>
      The mainstream scientific consensus (including the APA's 1995 task force "Intelligence:
      Knowns and Unknowns") is that mean score differences between groups are largely explained
      by environmental factors (education quality, socioeconomic conditions, test familiarity)
      rather than inherent bias in the instrument itself. But the debate continues.
    </p>

    <h2>The Flynn Effect: What It Tells Us About IQ Accuracy</h2>
    <p>
      Average IQ has risen ~3 points per decade throughout the 20th century — a cumulative gain
      of ~30 points. This poses an interesting validity question: if today's average person is
      30 IQ points "smarter" than someone in 1900, does that mean our ancestors were cognitively
      impaired? Almost certainly not. More likely, today's populations are better at the specific
      abstract reasoning skills IQ tests measure, due to education and environmental improvements.
    </p>
    <p>
      This suggests IQ tests measure something real but also something that's culturally and
      environmentally shaped — not a pure readout of innate brain capacity.
    </p>

    <h2>Online Tests vs. Clinical Tests</h2>
    <p>
      Most free online IQ tests are not validated to clinical standards. They lack proper normative
      samples, have not been tested for reliability or predictive validity, and many are designed
      to produce flattering scores (inflated results drive sharing and engagement). Some online
      tests use credible methods — particularly those based on matrix reasoning and normed against
      large samples.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our test is designed around pattern recognition and logical reasoning questions comparable
      to established IQ instruments, with score interpretation anchored to normative distributions.
      It provides a useful estimate — but for high-stakes decisions, a clinical evaluation with
      the WAIS-IV by a licensed psychologist is the gold standard. Learn more about different
      options in our <Link to="/mensa-iq-test">Mensa IQ test guide</Link>.

    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

    <h3>How accurate are IQ tests?</h3>
    <p>
      Clinical tests like the WAIS-IV have reliability of ~0.90–0.96. Online tests vary widely —
      most are substantially less reliable.
    </p>

    <h3>Are IQ tests culturally biased?</h3>
    <p>
      Modern tests have reduced overt bias, but group score differences persist. The causes are
      contested; environmental explanations are mainstream. Raven's Matrices is the most
      culture-fair option.
    </p>

    <h3>Are online IQ tests accurate?</h3>
    <p>
      Most are not clinically validated. Look for tests using matrix reasoning and large normative
      samples. Treat results as estimates.
    </p>

    <h3>What is the most accurate IQ test?</h3>
    <p>
      WAIS-IV and Stanford-Binet 5 are the clinical gold standards, administered by licensed
      psychologists. For self-assessment, Raven's Matrices is the most reliable non-clinical option.
