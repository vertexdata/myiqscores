    <h1>Exercise and IQ: How <span className="gradient-text">Physical Activity</span> Boosts Cognitive Performance</h1>

    <p>
      Of all the lifestyle interventions claimed to improve cognitive function, aerobic exercise has
      among the strongest and most consistent scientific support. Unlike many brain-training apps,
      supplements, or cognitive interventions that show promising early results but fail to replicate,
      the cognitive benefits of regular physical exercise have been demonstrated across hundreds of
      studies spanning multiple decades, populations, and methodologies.
    </p>
    <p>
      The connection between physical movement and mental performance isn't just a pleasant
      correlation. Researchers have now mapped the biological mechanisms in detail — and the picture
      that emerges is both surprising and actionable.
    </p>

    <h2>What the Research Shows: IQ and Exercise</h2>
    <p>
      Multiple meta-analyses have quantified the effect of aerobic exercise on cognitive performance:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        A 2018 meta-analysis in the British Journal of Sports Medicine, analyzing 39 randomized
        controlled trials (RCTs), found that acute exercise improved cognitive performance by
        approximately <strong>0.6 standard deviations</strong> — a substantial effect equivalent
        to roughly 9 IQ points on specific tasks
      </li>
      <li>
        Long-term exercise programs (weeks to months) produce sustained cognitive improvements
        of approximately <strong>0.3–0.5 SD</strong> — roughly 5–7 IQ-equivalent points on
        affected domains
      </li>
      <li>
        The domains most consistently improved are <strong>executive function</strong> (planning,
        decision-making, cognitive flexibility), <strong>working memory</strong>, and
        <strong>processing speed</strong>
      </li>
      <li>
        Children who exercise more perform better in school — a 2016 study in Pediatrics found
        that just 10 additional minutes of daily physical activity improved academic test scores
        and cognitive function in elementary school children
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>The Biology: How Exercise Changes the Brain</h2>
    <p>
      Exercise affects the brain through several distinct biological pathways:
    </p>

    <h3>BDNF: "Miracle-Gro for the Brain"</h3>
    <p>
      Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is a protein that promotes the growth, maintenance,
      and survival of neurons. John Ratey, a Harvard psychiatry professor, famously called it
      "Miracle-Gro for the brain." Exercise is the most powerful natural trigger for BDNF release.
    </p>
    <p>
      BDNF is particularly active in the hippocampus — the brain region most critical for learning
      and memory formation. Exercise-induced BDNF elevation promotes:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Neurogenesis (the creation of new neurons) in the hippocampus</li>
      <li>Strengthening of synaptic connections (synaptic potentiation)</li>
      <li>Protection of existing neurons from damage and aging</li>
      <li>Improved learning efficiency and memory consolidation</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Cerebral Blood Flow</h3>
    <p>
      Aerobic exercise increases cerebral blood flow — delivering more oxygen and glucose to brain
      tissue. Research using fMRI shows that a single aerobic exercise session increases blood flow
      to the prefrontal cortex, the region most responsible for executive function, working memory,
      and fluid reasoning. This acute increase in perfusion correlates with improved cognitive
      performance in the hours following exercise.
    </p>
    <p>
      Long-term aerobic exercise promotes angiogenesis — the growth of new blood vessels in the
      brain — creating a more robust cerebrovascular infrastructure that maintains cognitive function
      more effectively as we age.
    </p>

    <h3>Neurotransmitter Effects</h3>
    <p>
      Exercise influences multiple neurotransmitter systems that directly affect cognitive function:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Dopamine</strong> — increased dopamine release improves motivation, attention,
        working memory, and reward processing
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Norepinephrine</strong> — elevated norepinephrine enhances focus, alertness,
        and attention — effects similar to stimulant ADHD medications
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Serotonin</strong> — increased serotonin improves mood, reduces anxiety, and
        supports overall cognitive readiness
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Glutamate and GABA</strong> — exercise optimizes the balance of excitatory and
        inhibitory neurotransmission, improving signal clarity in neural networks
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Neuroinflammation Reduction</h3>
    <p>
      Chronic low-grade inflammation in the brain is increasingly recognized as a major driver of
      cognitive decline and neurodegenerative disease. Regular exercise has potent
      anti-inflammatory effects, reducing levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (like IL-6, TNF-α)
      that damage neurons and impair cognitive function.
    </p>
    <p>
      This anti-inflammatory effect may partly explain why regular exercisers show dramatically
      lower rates of dementia and cognitive decline — they're protecting their brains from
      inflammatory damage throughout their lives.
    </p>

    <h2>Which Type of Exercise Is Best?</h2>
    <p>
      Not all exercise affects the brain equally. Here's what research shows about different
      exercise types:
    </p>
    <table>
      <thead>
        <tr><th>Exercise Type</th><th>Cognitive Benefit</th><th>Evidence Quality</th></tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr><td>Moderate aerobic (running, cycling, swimming)</td><td>Executive function, working memory, processing speed, mood</td><td>Very strong (100+ RCTs)</td></tr>
        <tr><td>High-intensity interval training (HIIT)</td><td>Acute cognitive boost, executive function; especially high BDNF response</td><td>Strong and growing</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Resistance training</td><td>Executive function, memory, brain volume preservation</td><td>Strong</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Mind-body exercise (yoga, tai chi)</td><td>Attention, working memory, stress reduction</td><td>Moderate</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Team sports</td><td>Executive function, plus social cognitive benefits</td><td>Good</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Dance</td><td>Processing speed, spatial cognition, balance, mood</td><td>Moderate-good</td></tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
    <p>
      The strongest evidence is for moderate aerobic exercise, but combining aerobic with
      resistance training appears to produce additive cognitive benefits — likely because they
      activate partially distinct biological pathways.
    </p>

    <h2>Acute vs. Long-Term Cognitive Effects</h2>
    <p>
      Exercise affects cognition in two distinct timeframes:
    </p>

    <h3>Acute Effects (Immediately After Exercise)</h3>
    <p>
      A single aerobic exercise session produces measurable cognitive improvements that last
      approximately 1–4 hours afterward. This makes exercise timing strategically important:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Exercise before cognitively demanding tasks (study sessions, important meetings, exams)</li>
      <li>Even a 20-minute brisk walk produces meaningful acute cognitive improvements</li>
      <li>HIIT produces the strongest acute cognitive boost but requires a recovery period for
      full effect</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Long-Term Structural Effects</h3>
    <p>
      Regular exercise (weeks to months) produces lasting changes in brain structure:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Increased hippocampal volume — counteracting the age-related shrinkage that impairs memory</li>
      <li>Greater prefrontal cortex thickness — associated with better executive function</li>
      <li>Larger white matter volume — supporting faster neural signal transmission between regions</li>
      <li>Higher overall brain volume — regular exercisers show less brain atrophy with aging</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      A landmark study by Erickson et al. (2011) showed that 1 year of aerobic exercise increased
      hippocampal volume by 2%, effectively reversing 1–2 years of age-related hippocampal decline
      in older adults.
    </p>

    <h2>Exercise and Dementia Prevention</h2>
    <p>
      Regular physical activity is one of the most well-supported lifestyle factors for reducing
      dementia risk:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Meta-analyses show 30–40% lower dementia risk in physically active individuals</li>
      <li>Exercise reduces risk factors for dementia (cardiovascular disease, diabetes, hypertension)</li>
      <li>BDNF-driven neurogenesis builds "cognitive reserve" — resistance to cognitive decline</li>
      <li>Even starting exercise in middle age substantially reduces later dementia risk</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The World Health Organization lists physical inactivity as one of the top modifiable risk
      factors for dementia — alongside smoking, excessive alcohol, and poor diet.
    </p>

    <h2>Practical Recommendations</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>For acute cognitive boost:</strong> 20–30 minutes of moderate aerobic exercise
        (e.g., brisk walk, light jog, cycling) before demanding mental work
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>For long-term cognitive benefits:</strong> 150+ minutes per week of moderate
        aerobic exercise, ideally spread across 4–5 sessions
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Add resistance training:</strong> 2–3 strength training sessions per week
        for additive cognitive and neuroprotective benefits
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Timing matters:</strong> Morning exercise tends to produce the most consistent
        cognitive benefits throughout the day; avoid intense exercise within 3 hours of sleep
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Consistency is key:</strong> The long-term structural brain benefits require
        sustained regular exercise — sporadic exercise produces minimal lasting change
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

    <h3>Does exercise increase IQ?</h3>
    <p>
      Aerobic exercise reliably improves performance on IQ-related cognitive tasks by 2–4
      IQ-equivalent points in controlled studies. The strongest effects are on executive function,
      working memory, and processing speed — core fluid intelligence components.
    </p>

    <h3>Which type of exercise is best for brain health?</h3>
    <p>
      Moderate aerobic exercise has the strongest evidence. HIIT produces particularly strong
      acute cognitive effects. Combining aerobic with resistance training is optimal. See our{" "}
      <Link to="/how-to-improve-iq">IQ improvement guide</Link> for additional strategies.
    </p>

    <h3>How much exercise is needed to improve brain function?</h3>
    <p>
      As little as 20–30 minutes of moderate aerobic exercise produces acute cognitive benefits.
      For long-term gains, 150+ minutes per week is recommended. Even increasing daily activity
      modestly (more walking, standing) improves cognitive outcomes.
    </p>

    <h3>Can exercise prevent cognitive decline?</h3>
    <p>
      Yes — physically active individuals have 30–40% lower dementia risk. Exercise increases
      BDNF, promotes neurogenesis, and reduces neuroinflammation, all of which protect against
      age-related cognitive decline.
