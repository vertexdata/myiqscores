    <h1>Emotional Intelligence vs IQ: <span className="gradient-text">Which Matters More</span>?</h1>

    <p>
      When Daniel Goleman published <em>Emotional Intelligence</em> in 1995, it became one of the
      bestselling psychology books of all time with a provocative claim: EQ (emotional quotient)
      matters more than IQ for success in life and work. The book sparked a debate that continues
      today — one with real implications for how we educate children, hire employees, and develop
      leaders.
    </p>

    <h2>What Is Emotional Intelligence?</h2>
    <p>
      Emotional intelligence was originally defined by psychologists Peter Salovey and John Mayer
      as the ability to perceive, use, understand, and manage emotions — in yourself and in others.
      Goleman expanded this into a five-component model that became widely adopted in business:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Self-awareness</strong> — recognizing your own emotions and how they affect your
        thoughts and behavior; knowing your strengths and weaknesses.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Self-regulation</strong> — managing disruptive emotions and impulses; adapting
        to changing circumstances; maintaining honesty and integrity.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Motivation</strong> — a passion to work for internal reasons beyond money or
        status; persisting in the face of setbacks and failure.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Empathy</strong> — considering others' feelings, especially when making decisions;
        recognizing emotional cues in others.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Social skills</strong> — managing relationships to move people in desired directions;
        finding common ground; building rapport.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>IQ and Career Success: The 120 Threshold</h2>
    <p>
      One of the most important — and most overlooked — findings in intelligence research is the
      <strong>threshold effect at approximately IQ 120</strong>. Below this level, IQ is a
      meaningful predictor of professional performance. Above it, the marginal return on additional
      IQ points diminishes sharply.
    </p>
    <p>
      This makes intuitive sense: most professional environments require "good enough" cognitive
      ability to master the technical demands of the role. Once that threshold is met, what
      differentiates high performers from average performers is not more raw intelligence but
      interpersonal skills, resilience, judgment, and motivation — exactly what EQ measures.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>

    <h2>EQ and Leadership: The Research</h2>
    <p>
      The evidence for EQ in leadership is compelling. A landmark study by the Center for Creative
      Leadership found that the primary causes of executive derailment — the reasons high-potential
      leaders fail to reach their potential — were almost entirely emotional in nature: poor
      interpersonal skills, inability to manage stress, failure to build and maintain relationships,
      and inability to adapt. Not insufficient intelligence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Goleman's research across 200 global companies found that emotional competencies accounted
      for two-thirds of the performance difference between star performers and average performers
      in senior leadership positions. IQ contributed the remaining third — and was essentially
      a hygiene factor: you needed to be above a certain threshold, but above that, more IQ
      didn't differentiate.
    </p>

    <h2>Can EQ Be Improved?</h2>
    <p>
      Unlike IQ — which is relatively stable in adulthood and resistant to large interventions —
      EQ appears to be substantially more trainable. Studies on EQ development programs show
      measurable improvements in self-awareness, empathy, and emotional regulation, particularly
      with:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Mindfulness and meditation practice (improves self-awareness and emotional regulation)</li>
      <li>Therapy and coaching focused on interpersonal patterns</li>
      <li>Deliberate practice of perspective-taking and active listening</li>
      <li>360-degree feedback in organizational settings</li>
      <li>Challenging life experiences that force emotional growth</li>
    </ul>
    <p>

    </p>

    <h2>The Criticisms of EQ Research</h2>
    <p>
      Not everyone is convinced. Psychologists like Locke and Roberts argue that "emotional
      intelligence" as typically measured overlaps substantially with existing personality traits
      (especially agreeableness and emotional stability from the Big Five), and that EQ tests often
      have questionable validity. The prediction of outcomes attributed to EQ, critics argue, often
      disappears when Big Five personality traits are controlled for.
    </p>
    <p>
      Goleman himself has been accused of overstating the case in his popular writing. The academic
      literature on EQ, while generally supportive of its predictive value, shows more modest
      effect sizes than his books suggest.
    </p>

    <h2>The Integrated View: Both Matter for Different Things</h2>
    <p>
      The most defensible position from the evidence is that IQ and EQ are both real, both
      matter, and they matter for different things. IQ is the more powerful predictor for academic
      achievement and technical problem-solving. EQ is the more powerful predictor for leadership,
      teamwork, and emotional wellbeing. For most careers and life outcomes, some threshold of
      both is required, and the returns on each depend heavily on context.
