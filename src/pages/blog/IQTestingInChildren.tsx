    <h1>IQ Testing in Children: <span className="gradient-text">What Parents and Educators</span> Need to Know</h1>

    <p>
      Few topics generate more parental anxiety — and more misunderstanding — than childhood IQ
      testing. Parents wonder whether to have their child tested, what the results mean, and whether
      a number from a test at age 7 will define their child's educational trajectory. Educators
      grapple with using scores to make placement decisions with imperfect information.
    </p>
    <p>
      This guide provides an honest, research-grounded overview of what childhood IQ testing can
      and cannot tell you, when it's appropriate, how to interpret results, and how to use (or not
      use) scores appropriately.
    </p>

    <h2>Tests Used for Children's IQ Assessment</h2>
    <p>
      Several tests are commonly used for clinical IQ assessment in children. Online tests like
      ours provide general estimates, but for high-stakes decisions (educational placement, learning
      disability diagnosis), a clinical assessment by a licensed psychologist using standardized
      tests is essential.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children, Fifth Edition (WISC-V)</strong> — the
        gold standard for ages 6–16. Measures five primary domains: Verbal Comprehension, Visual
        Spatial, Fluid Reasoning, Working Memory, and Processing Speed. The most widely used
        children's IQ test in clinical practice.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence (WPPSI-IV)</strong> — for
        ages 2:6 to 7:7. Designed for young children with age-appropriate tasks.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Stanford-Binet Intelligence Scales, Fifth Edition (SB5)</strong> — assesses ages
        2 to 85+ on five factors: Fluid Reasoning, Knowledge, Quantitative Reasoning, Visual-Spatial
        Processing, and Working Memory.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Kaufman Assessment Battery for Children (KABC-II)</strong> — emphasizes
        sequential and simultaneous processing; useful for diverse populations and children with
        language differences.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Raven's Progressive Matrices (CPM/SPM)</strong> — nonverbal, culture-reduced
        fluid reasoning test; excellent for children with language barriers or English Language
        Learner status.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>When Is IQ Testing Appropriate for Children?</h2>
    <p>
      Clinical IQ testing is most appropriate and valuable in specific situations:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Suspected learning disability</strong> — IQ testing combined with achievement
        testing helps identify specific learning disabilities (like dyslexia) by revealing
        discrepancies between ability and achievement
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Gifted program evaluation</strong> — determining eligibility for gifted education
        programs that use IQ cutoffs
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Developmental delay assessment</strong> — understanding a child's cognitive
        profile to guide intervention and support planning
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>ADHD or autism spectrum evaluation</strong> — IQ is part of a comprehensive
        neuropsychological assessment for these conditions, helping distinguish cognitive
        strengths from challenges
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Placement decisions</strong> — when school placement (specialized programs,
        acceleration, or support services) requires objective cognitive data
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      What IQ testing is generally <em>not</em> appropriate for:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Casual parental curiosity without a specific educational or developmental concern</li>
      <li>Comparing children within a family</li>
      <li>Making broad predictions about a child's future</li>
      <li>Labeling children in ways that affect their self-concept</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How Stable Are Children's IQ Scores?</h2>
    <p>
      This is one of the most important things parents need to understand: <strong>childhood IQ
      scores are not fixed</strong>, particularly for younger children.
    </p>
    <table>
      <thead>
        <tr><th>Age at Testing</th><th>Correlation with Adult IQ</th><th>Stability</th></tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr><td>Age 2–3</td><td>~0.3</td><td>Very unstable</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Age 4–5</td><td>~0.5</td><td>Unstable</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Age 6–7</td><td>~0.6</td><td>Moderate stability</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Age 8–12</td><td>~0.7–0.8</td><td>Increasing stability</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Adolescence (13–17)</td><td>~0.85–0.90</td><td>High stability</td></tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
    <p>
      A child who scores 115 at age 5 might score 135 at age 10 — or 100. This instability is
      partly because intellectual development proceeds at uneven rates, partly because tests at
      different ages measure somewhat different abilities, and partly because environment continues
      to shape cognitive development throughout childhood.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is one reason most psychologists advise against placing enormous weight on IQ tests
      administered before age 7–8, and against treating any childhood IQ score as definitive.
    </p>

    <h2>Understanding a Child's IQ Profile</h2>
    <p>
      One of the most important — and underappreciated — features of modern IQ testing is the
      <strong>cognitive profile</strong>. Rather than just a single number, tests like the WISC-V
      produce a detailed profile across multiple domains. This profile is often more useful than
      the Full-Scale IQ alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Common profile patterns and what they suggest:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>High Verbal, lower Perceptual</strong> — typically strong language-based learner;
        may excel in reading, writing, and discussion-based subjects; may struggle with hands-on
        tasks, maps, or visual puzzles
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>High Perceptual, lower Verbal</strong> — often strong in math, science, spatial
        reasoning; may struggle with language arts; sometimes seen in 2e (twice-exceptional)
        students
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>High overall IQ with low Processing Speed</strong> — common profile in gifted
        students with ADHD or anxiety; the student knows the answers but can't output information
        fast enough; often frustrated by timed tests
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>High overall IQ with low Working Memory</strong> — often seen in ADHD; strong
        reasoning capability but struggles to hold multiple pieces in mind; may forget
        multi-step instructions
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>IQ and Giftedness</h2>
    <p>
      The term "gifted" refers to children who show exceptionally advanced cognitive ability,
      usually defined by an IQ score of 130 or above (the top ~2%). Most gifted education
      programs use this threshold, though many schools also use multiple criteria.
    </p>
    <p>
      Levels of giftedness by IQ score (approximately):
    </p>
    <table>
      <thead>
        <tr><th>IQ Range</th><th>Category</th><th>Approximate Prevalence</th></tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr><td>120–129</td><td>Superior / Mildly Gifted</td><td>Top 9%</td></tr>
        <tr><td>130–144</td><td>Gifted</td><td>Top 2%</td></tr>
        <tr><td>145–159</td><td>Highly Gifted</td><td>Top 0.1%</td></tr>
        <tr><td>160+</td><td>Profoundly Gifted</td><td>1 in 11,000+</td></tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
    <p>
      Profoundly gifted children (IQ 160+) often require dramatically different educational
      approaches — standard gifted programs may be insufficiently challenging. Resources like
      the Davidson Institute and SENG provide support for families of highly and profoundly
      gifted children.

    <h2>How Parents Should Talk to Children About IQ</h2>
    <p>
      If a child has been tested, how parents discuss the results can significantly affect the
      child's relationship with learning:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Avoid treating IQ as identity.</strong> "You're so smart" based on a number
        creates a fixed mindset. Research by Carol Dweck shows that praising effort over ability
        produces more resilient learners.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Contextualize the score.</strong> Explain that IQ measures certain types of thinking
        on a particular day, not overall worth or potential.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Focus on the profile, not the number.</strong> "The test shows you're particularly
        strong at visual puzzles and logical reasoning" is more useful than "Your IQ is 125."
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Emphasize growth.</strong> IQ is not fixed, especially in childhood. Hard work,
        learning, and new experiences continue to build cognitive ability.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

    <h3>At what age can children take an IQ test?</h3>
    <p>
      The WPPSI can assess children from age 2:6. The WISC-V covers ages 6–16. However, scores
      before age 5 are notably unstable and should be interpreted with great caution. See our{" "}
      <Link to="/iq-by-age/children-6-12">IQ by age for children</Link> for more context.
    </p>

    <h3>What is a gifted IQ score for a child?</h3>
    <p>
      Most gifted programs use 130+ as the threshold (top ~2%). Highly gifted is typically 145+
      (top 0.1%). See our <Link to="/genius-iq">genius IQ guide</Link> for more detail on
      high-range scores.
    </p>

    <h3>How reliable are childhood IQ scores?</h3>
    <p>
      Reliability increases with age. Scores before age 5 are quite unstable. By age 8–12,
      stability increases substantially. Adolescent scores predict adult IQ with correlations
      of 0.85–0.90.
    </p>

    <h3>Should parents have their child IQ tested?</h3>
    <p>
      Clinical testing is most valuable for specific purposes: suspected learning disability,
      gifted placement, ADHD/autism evaluation. Casual testing out of curiosity is generally
      not recommended by child psychologists.
