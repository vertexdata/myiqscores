    <h1>Types of IQ Tests: <span className="gradient-text">Complete Guide to Intelligence Testing</span></h1>

    <p>
      Not all IQ tests are created equal. From the gold-standard clinical WAIS to free online
      assessments, IQ tests vary enormously in what they measure, how accurate they are, and what
      their scores mean. Here's a complete breakdown of every major IQ test type, who they're
      designed for, and which ones actually produce reliable results.
    </p>

    <h2>The Major Clinical IQ Tests</h2>

    <h3>WAIS — Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale</h3>
    <p>
      The <strong>WAIS-IV</strong> is the gold standard for adult IQ testing worldwide. Developed
      by David Wechsler, it measures four cognitive domains across 10 core subtests:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Verbal Comprehension</strong> — vocabulary, similarities, information</li>
      <li><strong>Perceptual Reasoning</strong> — block design, matrix reasoning, visual puzzles</li>
      <li><strong>Working Memory</strong> — digit span, arithmetic</li>
      <li><strong>Processing Speed</strong> — symbol search, coding</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The WAIS produces a Full Scale IQ score (mean 100, SD 15) and is administered one-on-one by
      a licensed psychologist over 1-2 hours. It costs $200-$500 depending on the provider. This
      is the test to take if you want the most reliable, comprehensive IQ measurement. See our{" "}
      <Link to="/iq-score-ranges">IQ score ranges guide</Link> for what WAIS scores mean.
    </p>

    <h3>WISC — Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children</h3>
    <p>
      The <strong>WISC-V</strong> is the WAIS equivalent for children ages 6-16. It measures the
      same four domains plus a fifth (Fluid Reasoning) and is the most commonly used test for
      identifying giftedness and learning disabilities in children. Schools often use the WISC
      for special education eligibility. See our <Link to="/iq-by-age/children">children's IQ page</Link>.
    </p>

    <h3>Stanford-Binet Intelligence Scales</h3>
    <p>
      The <strong>Stanford-Binet 5</strong> has the longest history of any IQ test, originating
      from Alfred Binet's 1905 test. The current version measures five factors: Fluid Reasoning,
      Knowledge, Quantitative Reasoning, Visual-Spatial Processing, and Working Memory. It's
      used for ages 2 through adulthood and is particularly useful for testing at the extremes
      (very high or very low IQ). Learn more about <Link to="/what-is-iq">the history of IQ testing</Link>.
    </p>

    <h3>Raven's Progressive Matrices</h3>
    <p>
      <strong>Raven's SPM</strong> (Standard Progressive Matrices) is a non-verbal test that
      measures fluid intelligence — abstract reasoning without relying on language or cultural
      knowledge. Test-takers complete visual patterns of increasing difficulty. It's widely used
      in cross-cultural research because it minimizes language and cultural bias. The test takes
      about 45 minutes and produces a percentile ranking.
    </p>

    <h3>Cattell Culture Fair Intelligence Test</h3>
    <p>
      Designed to minimize cultural and educational bias, the <strong>Cattell CFIT</strong> uses
      abstract shapes and patterns rather than language-dependent questions. It primarily measures
      fluid intelligence and is useful for testing individuals from different cultural backgrounds.
      <Link to="/mensa-iq-test"> Mensa</Link> uses the Cattell scale (SD 24) alongside other tests.
    </p>

    <h2>Specialized and Screening Tests</h2>

    <h3>Wonderlic Personnel Test</h3>
    <p>
      The <strong>Wonderlic</strong> is a 12-minute, 50-question test widely used in employment
      screening, most famously by the NFL at the Scouting Combine. It measures general cognitive
      ability and produces scores from 0-50 (average ~20, roughly equivalent to IQ 100). It's
      quick but less comprehensive than full clinical tests.
    </p>

    <h3>Cognitive Abilities Test (CogAT)</h3>
    <p>
      The <strong>CogAT</strong> is commonly used in US schools for gifted program placement.
      It measures verbal, quantitative, and nonverbal reasoning in children grades K-12. While
      not technically an IQ test, CogAT scores correlate highly with IQ and are used similarly.
    </p>

    <h3>Kaufman Assessment Battery for Children (KABC)</h3>
    <p>
      The <strong>KABC-II</strong> is designed to be more culturally fair than the WISC, with
      less emphasis on verbal skills. It measures simultaneous processing, sequential processing,
      planning, learning, and knowledge. It's often used when traditional IQ tests may
      disadvantage children from non-English-speaking backgrounds.
    </p>

    <h2>Online IQ Tests: Are They Accurate?</h2>
    <p>
      Most online IQ tests are <strong>not clinically validated</strong> and should be treated as
      entertainment rather than accurate measurement. Common issues include:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Score inflation</strong> — many online tests overestimate IQ by 10-20 points to make users feel good and share results</li>
      <li><strong>No standardization</strong> — they aren't normed on representative populations</li>
      <li><strong>No proctoring</strong> — users can look up answers or take the test multiple times</li>
      <li><strong>Limited subtests</strong> — most only measure one or two cognitive domains</li>
      <li><strong>Self-selection bias</strong> — people who take online IQ tests aren't representative of the general population</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      That said, well-designed online tests can provide a <strong>rough estimate</strong> (±10-15
      points) of your cognitive ability. <Link to="/test">Our free IQ test</Link> uses pattern
      recognition and logical reasoning questions similar to those on standardized tests.
      For a precise measurement, consult a licensed psychologist.
