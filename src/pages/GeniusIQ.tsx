    <h1><span className="gradient-text">Genius IQ:</span> What Score Makes You a Genius?</h1>

    <p>
      The word "genius" gets thrown around casually, but in IQ terms, it has a specific meaning. While
      there's no single official threshold, <strong>an IQ of 140 or above</strong> is the most widely
      accepted definition of genius-level intelligence. Here's everything you need to know about what
      it means to be a genius — by the numbers and beyond.
    </p>

    <h2>What Does Genius-Level IQ Look Like?</h2>
    <p>
      People with IQs of <Link to="/is-140-iq-good">140+</Link> often describe their experience of
      thinking as qualitatively different from the norm:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Rapid pattern recognition</strong> — seeing connections between seemingly unrelated ideas almost instantly</li>
      <li><strong>Deep abstraction</strong> — comfortably thinking several levels of abstraction above concrete reality</li>
      <li><strong>Information hunger</strong> — a near-constant drive to learn, understand, and analyze</li>
      <li><strong>Complex working memory</strong> — holding and manipulating many variables simultaneously</li>
      <li><strong>Intellectual impatience</strong> — frustration when others can't keep up or when explanations are too slow</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      However, not all geniuses fit the stereotype. Many are socially skilled, emotionally healthy,
      and lead conventional lives. The "tortured genius" trope is more myth than reality for most
      high-IQ individuals.

    <h2>The Genius Paradox</h2>
    <p>
      Here's something counterintuitive: <strong>genius-level IQ doesn't guarantee genius-level
      achievement</strong>. The Terman Study followed 1,500 children with IQs above 135 throughout
      their lives. While many became successful professionals, none won a Nobel Prize. Meanwhile, two
      children who were <em>rejected</em> from the study for having IQs that were too low — William
      Shockley and Luis Alvarez — both went on to win Nobel Prizes.
    </p>
    <p>
      This paradox reveals that above a threshold of approximately 120-130, factors other than IQ
      become dominant: creativity, persistence, domain expertise, timing, and luck. Having a 140 IQ
      gives you the cognitive <em>tools</em> for genius-level work, but using those tools effectively
      requires traits that IQ tests don't measure.
    </p>

    <h2>The Dark Side of Genius</h2>
    <p>
      Research on very high-IQ individuals reveals some challenges:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Intellectual isolation</strong> — difficulty finding peers who think at a similar level</li>
      <li><strong>Perfectionism</strong> — holding oneself to impossibly high standards</li>
      <li><strong>Existential overthinking</strong> — heightened awareness of life's complexities and uncertainties</li>
      <li><strong>Underachievement</strong> — some gifted individuals struggle with motivation when nothing feels challenging enough</li>
      <li><strong>Imposter syndrome</strong> — paradoxically common among the gifted, who compare themselves to unrealistically high standards</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      These challenges are manageable, and most high-IQ individuals lead fulfilling lives. But the
      notion that genius is purely a blessing oversimplifies the reality.
    </p>

    <h2>Can You Become a Genius?</h2>
    <p>
      Honestly? Probably not in the IQ sense. IQ is 50-80% genetic and relatively stable in adulthood.
      However, you <em>can</em> develop genius-level expertise in a specific domain through what
      researcher Anders Ericsson called "deliberate practice" — focused, structured improvement over
      many years. Many of history's greatest contributions came not from the highest-IQ people but
      from deeply dedicated experts who worked at the frontier of their fields for decades.
