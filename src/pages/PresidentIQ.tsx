    </h1>

    <p>
      <strong>Important note:</strong> Presidential IQ scores are estimates — not verified test
      results. No sitting or former US president has publicly released a certified IQ score. These
      estimates come from political scientists, historians, and psychologists who analyze
      presidents' writing, academic records, decision-making patterns, and cognitive achievements
      to infer approximate IQ ranges. The most rigorous academic work in this area was conducted
      by psychologist Dean Keith Simonton of UC Davis, whose research on presidential intelligence
      and leadership has been published in peer-reviewed journals. Other estimates come from
      historians and political scientists applying their own analytical frameworks.
    </p>
    <p>
      All estimates below carry meaningful uncertainty — they should be read as informed scholarly
      guesses, not measurements. To learn more about what IQ actually measures, see our{" "}

    <h2>The Most Surprising Estimates</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>George W. Bush (~125):</strong> Bush is often assumed to have been below average
      intellectually, partly due to gaffes and a folksy communication style. But he earned a
      bachelor's degree from Yale and an MBA from Harvard Business School — both highly selective
      programs. Psychologist Dean Simonton's research estimates his IQ at approximately 125,
      placing him in the superior range. His presidency's outcomes are a separate question from
      his cognitive ability.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Abraham Lincoln (~128):</strong> Lincoln had almost no formal education — less than
      a year total — yet taught himself law, read voraciously, and produced some of the most
      eloquent presidential prose in American history (the Gettysburg Address, Second Inaugural).
      His estimated IQ is relatively modest for this list, but his achievement given his
      circumstances may represent the most impressive cognitive story of any president.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Jimmy Carter (~156):</strong> Carter graduated from the US Naval Academy and was
      selected for the Navy's nuclear submarine program under Admiral Hyman Rickover — one of the
      most cognitively demanding selection processes in the US military. He is widely estimated as
      one of the most intellectually capable presidents. His political difficulties in office
      illustrate that high IQ doesn't guarantee effective leadership.
    </p>

    <h2>What Makes a President Smart?</h2>
    <p>
      Presidential effectiveness depends on multiple types of intelligence that IQ tests only
      partially capture:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Political intelligence:</strong> Understanding power dynamics, coalition-building,
        and the art of what's achievable. FDR was a master; Carter, despite higher estimated IQ,
        struggled here.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Communication intelligence:</strong> The ability to distill complex ideas into
        persuasive public language. Lincoln, Obama, and Reagan excelled at this regardless of
        IQ differences.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Crisis intelligence:</strong> Remaining analytical under extreme pressure with
        incomplete information. Kennedy's handling of the Cuban Missile Crisis is the canonical
        example.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Strategic intelligence:</strong> Long-term planning and anticipating consequences.
        Nixon's China opening required cognitive flexibility that purely high-IQ analytical
        thinking might not have produced.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>The IQ-Success Paradox in the White House</h2>
    <p>
      Perhaps the most instructive finding from presidential IQ research is the weak relationship
      between estimated IQ and historical presidential ranking. Warren Harding — often rated the
      worst president in American history — has been estimated at IQ 140+. Jimmy Carter, estimated
      at 156, is consistently ranked in the middle tier despite his exceptional intellect. Some of
      the most consequential presidents (Lincoln, Washington, Truman) had more modest estimated
      IQs compared to their peers.
    </p>
    <p>
      This pattern mirrors research on CEOs and leaders more broadly: above a threshold of roughly
      120, incremental IQ gains matter far less than judgment, emotional intelligence, communication
      skill, and the ability to build trust. The presidency rewards a particular combination of
      cognitive, social, and emotional abilities that no single test captures.

    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

    <h3>Which US president had the highest IQ?</h3>
    <p>
      John Adams is most frequently estimated as the highest at approximately 173. Thomas Jefferson
      (~160) and Woodrow Wilson (~155) are commonly ranked close behind. These are scholarly
      estimates, not verified scores.
    </p>

    <h3>What is Donald Trump's IQ?</h3>
    <p>
      Estimates range from approximately 120 to 156 depending on the analyst. His Wharton School
      degree and business achievements suggest above-average intelligence, while academic researcher
      Dean Simonton's model placed him around 156. The wide range reflects genuine analytical
      disagreement. See our full analysis on the{" "}
      <Link to="/famous-iq/donald-trump">Donald Trump IQ page</Link>.
    </p>

    <h3>What is Barack Obama's IQ?</h3>
    <p>
      Obama's IQ is estimated at 130–145 based on his Harvard Law magna cum laude degree and
      Harvard Law Review presidency. See our{" "}
      <Link to="/famous-iq/barack-obama">Barack Obama IQ page</Link> for full analysis.
    </p>

    <h3>Does a high IQ make a president successful?</h3>
    <p>
      Not reliably. The historical record shows weak correlation between presidential IQ estimates
      and historical effectiveness rankings. Political intelligence, communication ability, and
      emotional judgment appear equally or more important than raw cognitive ability.
