    <h1>What Is a <span className="gradient-text">Good IQ Score</span>?</h1>

    <p>
      "Is my IQ good?" It's the most common question people ask after taking an IQ test. The short
      answer: <strong>any score of 90 or above is considered average or better</strong>, and the
      vast majority of people fall in the 85-115 range. But what counts as "good" depends entirely
      on what you're comparing against and what your goals are.

    <h2>What "Good" Really Means</h2>
    <p>
      Here's the truth most IQ discussions miss: <strong>a "good" IQ is whatever allows you to
      achieve your goals</strong>. A score of 100 is perfectly good for running a successful business,
      raising a family, or excelling in most careers. A score of 130 isn't "better" in any universal
      sense — it just means certain types of abstract reasoning come more easily.
    </p>
    <p>
      Research consistently shows that above an IQ of approximately 115-120, additional IQ points
      have <strong>diminishing returns</strong> for career success, income, and life satisfaction.
      Personality traits like conscientiousness, social skills, emotional intelligence, and
      opportunity become the dominant factors. Many people with 100 IQs outperform people with 130
      IQs in their careers because of superior motivation, work ethic, or interpersonal skills.
    </p>

    <h2>Good IQ Scores for Specific Goals</h2>

    <h3>For College</h3>
    <p>
      An IQ of <Link to="/is-100-iq-good">100</Link> (average) is sufficient for most college
      programs. Competitive universities may implicitly select for IQs of 115+, and elite programs
      (Ivy League, MIT) may average 130+. But IQ is just one factor — GPA, extracurriculars, and
      test prep matter too. See our <Link to="/sat-to-iq">SAT to IQ conversion</Link> for how
      standardized test scores relate.
    </p>

    <h3>For Most Careers</h3>
    <p>
      An IQ of <Link to="/is-90-iq-good">90-110</Link> is adequate for the vast majority of
      careers. Demanding fields like <Link to="/iq-needed-for/doctor">medicine</Link> (120-130),{" "}
      <Link to="/iq-needed-for/lawyer">law</Link> (115-130), and{" "}
      <Link to="/iq-needed-for/engineer">engineering</Link> (115-128) tend to have higher averages,
      but individual variation is wide. See our full{" "}
      <Link to="/iq-needed-for/doctor">career IQ pages</Link> for specific professions.
    </p>

    <h3>For Mensa</h3>
    <p>
      <Link to="/is-130-iq-good">130</Link> is the minimum for Mensa membership (98th percentile).
      Only about 2% of the population qualifies. If your goal is Mensa, you need a "very superior"
      or "gifted" score.
    </p>

    <h3>For "Genius"</h3>
    <p>
      <Link to="/is-140-iq-good">140</Link> is the commonly cited genius threshold, though some
      definitions use 130 or 145. Only about 0.4% of people score this high. See our page on the{" "}
      <Link to="/highest-iq-ever">highest IQ scores ever recorded</Link>.
    </p>

    <h2>Why You Shouldn't Obsess Over Your Score</h2>
    <p>
      IQ tests measure specific types of cognitive ability — logical reasoning, pattern recognition,
      processing speed, working memory. They do <strong>not</strong> measure:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Creativity and artistic ability</li>
      <li>Emotional intelligence and empathy</li>
      <li>Practical wisdom and common sense</li>
      <li>Motivation, discipline, and work ethic</li>
      <li>Social skills and leadership ability</li>
      <li>Musical, athletic, or physical intelligence</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      A "good" life doesn't require a high IQ. It requires finding work that suits your strengths,
      building meaningful relationships, maintaining your health, and pursuing goals that matter to
      you. IQ is one tool in a large toolkit.
    </p>

    <h2>Good IQ by Age</h2>
    <p>
      IQ is age-normed, so "good" is the same at every age — 100 is always average for your age
      group. However, cognitive abilities change across the lifespan:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><Link to="/iq-by-age/children">Children</Link> — scores can be volatile; don't over-interpret</li>
      <li><Link to="/iq-by-age/teenagers">Teenagers</Link> — scores stabilizing, good time to test</li>
      <li><Link to="/iq-by-age/young-adults">Young adults</Link> — fluid intelligence peaks</li>
      <li><Link to="/iq-by-age/adults">Adults</Link> — most stable period for IQ measurement</li>
      <li><Link to="/iq-by-age/seniors">Seniors</Link> — crystallized intelligence stays strong</li>
    </ul>
